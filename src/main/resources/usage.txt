Usage:

java -jar BackupTool-<version?>.jar <path> [force]

Arguments:

path - Path to configuration file.
force - Don't ask confirmation to start backup process after reading configurations.

Configuration file instructions:

- Leading '~' symbol is replaced with 'user.home' JVM environment variable. Exmpl. '~/Desktop' -> '/Users/<username>/Desktop' on MacOSX.

target = <destination directory>
    - If this directory doesn't exist, then it will be created.
    - All source files and folders are backed up to every target directory (unless 'copyOnlyToArrowTarget=true' and source is defined with arrow target).
    - '${date}' parameters are replaced with current date as 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
source = <file or directory to backup> [-> <target path>]
    - You can use arrow syntax to define the target directory, so that only this file is copied there.
    - If 'copyOnlyToArrowTarget=true' and the arrow target is defined, then the file is copied only to the arrow target.
forceReplaceExisting = <true/false>
    - If true, then replaces existing files (even not modified after last backup). Default value is false.
copyOnlyToArrowTarget = <true/false>
    - If true, then copies the source file only to arrow target if it is defined, otherwise copies it also to default target directories. Default true.
exclude = <name of directory or file>
    - Excludes files or directories matching that string. String have to match to the source file's name or absolute path.
    - Supports "*" (any) regex.
